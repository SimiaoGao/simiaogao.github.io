    <link href="http://ssgao.com/blog/2014/02/07/how-to-ssh-into-a-remote-host-without-password/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-07T21:53:05-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://ssgao.com/blog/2014/02/07/how-to-ssh-into-a-remote-host-without-password</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you identify yourself to a machine?</p>

<p>A intuitive answer would be to type in your username and password. That&rsquo;s what we normally do before we pay credit card, check grade, chat on facebook.</p>

<p>Well, remember that except a few occasions, normally the website that asks you to log in has an option that says &ldquo;remember me on this computer&rdquo;? Isn&rsquo;t that convenient? Isn&rsquo;t typing username and password during ssh process always a pinapple in the ass?</p>

<p>It turns out that SSH can do just the thing.</p>

<p>The machanism is a little bit hard to explain, which I think I should just come back later, let&rsquo;s see how it works.</p>

<p>First, under your local host&rsquo;s shell, type in</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <span class="s2">&quot;your_email@example.com&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;ll ask you for filename and password, just type enter when it asks for filename. For password, type in the one that you can always remember because you&rsquo;ll use it over and over again.</p>

<p>The output looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Generating public/private rsa key pair.

</span><span class='line'>|    .. .         |
</span><span class='line'>+-----------------+
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the process&rsquo;s complete, under your home directory will appear folder named <em>.ssh</em>. inside this folder there are two files: <em>id_rsa</em> and <em>id_rsa.pub</em>. For now, think <em>id_rsa.pub</em> as your username and think <em>id_rsa</em> as your password. Keep the <em>id_rsa</em> &ldquo;your password&rdquo; to yourself and not to anyone else because this is your secret identity now.</p>

<p>If you have a github repo set up, odds are that you&rsquo;ve done this already!</p>

<p>Next you need to send your <em>id_rsa.pub</em> &ldquo;your username&rdquo; to the server so that it has a record of you.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ssh-copy-id <span class="s2">&quot;username@remote-host&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># for example: ssh-copy-id &quot;simongao@ls.cs.rutgers.edu&quot; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># note that by using this command I am assuming that you didn&#39;t change the name of your key pairs which you generated from using earlier command from id_rsa to other names</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output looks like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>simongao@ls.cs.rutgers.edu<span class="sb">`</span>s password:
</span><span class='line'>Now try logging into the machine, with <span class="s2">&quot;ssh &#39;simongao@ls.cs.rutgers.edu&#39;&quot;</span>, and check in:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  .ssh/authorized_keys
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>to make sure we haven<span class="sb">`</span>t added extra keys that you weren<span class="sb">`</span>t expecting.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Congradulations! Now you&rsquo;ve sent your &ldquo;username&rdquo; to the remote host. The remote host has your record.</p>

<p>Now, try ssh again.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, is it still asking you for username?</p>

<p>For some stupid reason that <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/389921/how-to-avoid-typing-ssh-add-everytime">I haven&rsquo;t figure out</a>. Every time you start a shell, you always has to do <code>ssh-add</code> and type in the password to unlock your <em>id_rsa</em> file. Let&rsquo;s just remember this step, so type in <code>ssh-add</code> to your shell every time you start it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ssh-add
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Enter passphrase for /home/simongao/.ssh/id_rsa: </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Identity added: /home/simongao/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/simongao/.ssh/id_rsa)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, try ssh again.</p>

<p>It worked!! You don&rsquo;t need to type in password to ssh anymore!</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I hope, but occassionally shit happens. Like what happened to a CentOS server that I have for our big data project. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5251723/centos-scp-without-password-not-working">Check this SO post for a similar thing that happened</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been googling for how to solve this problem for an entire afternoon and evening, and heavily modified my <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> file, but still cannot solve it until a point from my friend. Though I don&rsquo;t know why this worked, neither do my friend, but I&rsquo;d just share it with you and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Inside your <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> file, there&rsquo;s a configuration called <em>StrictModes</em>. By default, it&rsquo;s either unset or turned to <em>yes</em>. You have to set it to <em>no</em> by adding this line to the file</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>StrictModes no
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That finally solved my issue.</p>

<p>Hope it works for you as well.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-31T14:19:04-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://ssgao.com/blog/2014/01/31/why-i-started-this-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello~</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking what should I post for the first blog for awhile, but haven&rsquo;t really came up with any good idea. So rather than me keep thinking forever, let&rsquo;s just talk about why I created this blog site.</p>

<p>As a novice developer, I often found myself struggling with two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bad Long Term Memory</strong>. Let&rsquo;s say that I want to set up something, for example, setting up hadoop server. I read instructions from book, google when I encounter a problem, and ask on stackoverflow if solution cannot be found. Eventually, I completed the task. Then six month later, something happens and I have to redo this exact same task again. Suddenly, I found that all my memory about what I did has been totally flushed. So, in the end, I have to start fresh again. This is really inefficient.</li>
<li><strong>Need a New Project Idea</strong>. I always want to create something, that&rsquo;s really why I choose to be a developer, but often of the time I found that coming up with a project idea is hard. So, with all the knowledge and skills, I have nothing to do.</li>
</ol>


<p>That sorta explains why I need this blog: to log what I&rsquo;ve done and to write thoughts that come up to my mind which has the potential to turn up to be a project.</p>

<p>It is a naive approach, but I seriously hope this could be a good start.</p>
